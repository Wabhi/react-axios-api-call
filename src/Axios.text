React Axios Tutorial â€“ Make HTTP GET and POST Requests===>

In this React Axios tutorial, we are going to learn how to make Axios 
GET, and POST requests using Axios. I will create a backend server for React app using MongoDB, Node, and Express.js. 
We will create a frontend using React.js and Bootstrap 4. Then,
we will learn to make REST API calls using Axios.

What is Axios?

Almost every web and mobile application retrieve the data when a user makes a request. 
Web applications get the data from the database when a user makes request.
Most of us every day publish new pictures of our family members, colleagues, and friends on facebook. 
You must remember when you click on the post button on facebook, and it publishes your data very quickly.

Web services are working behind an app to process the request made by a user. 
These requests are made through API (Application Programming Interface). 
The API helps in communicating with the server via a URL in the form of GET, POST, UPDATE, and Delete.

Now, here Axios comes into the light. 
Axios is a library used to make HTTP requests from the browser via Node and Express.js platform. 
Axios is a well-known package, and it has got around 63,431 stars on GitHub and forked nearly 5273 times at the time of creating this tutorial.
